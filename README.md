## 🔍 About This Repository

I created this repository to demonstrate my ability to:

* Write efficient SQL queries for **data extraction and manipulation**.
* Clean and transform raw datasets into formats suitable for analysis.
* Design and model relational databases using ER diagrams.
* Simulate structured SQL-based workflows inspired by modern data pipelines.

These projects reflect my growing understanding of the **data lifecycle** and its role in analytics and machine learning.
